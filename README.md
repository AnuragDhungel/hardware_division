# hardware_division
###This code is for finding the ratio of two numbers between 0 and 1 with the sum of the numbers.
### Let there be two numbers CL and CT.
### Both are in range [0,1].
### THis verilog code creates a hardware model to find CL/(CL+CT) and CT/(CL+CT).
### There is a parameter to be passes which places where the decimal number needs to be.
### The verilog code is in are in\division.srcs\sources_1\new
### The simulation code is in  \division.srcs\sim_1\new.
### Just download this code and you can run in vivado directly or,
### If you need to add this in your project, copy the code file from \division.srcs\sources_1\new to your project.
